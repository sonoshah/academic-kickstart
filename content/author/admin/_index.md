My name is Sono Shah. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the [University of California Riverside](http://politicalscience.ucr.edu/). I also work as a researcher at [AAPI Data](www.aapidata.com), where we make data on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders more accessible. This summer I am a graduate intern with the Global Migration & Demography team at Pew Research Center.
 
Iâ€™m interested in race & ethnicity, political participation, and civic engagement in the U.S. My dissertation focuses on Asian Americans and Latinos and their campaign contribution behavior where I use administrative records from the FEC as well as survey data from the National Asian American Survey. 

In addition, I serve as a researcher for the [Center for Social Innovation at UCR](http://socialinnovation.ucr.edu), where I help coordinate outreach efforts for the Inland Empire in preparation for Census 2020.
