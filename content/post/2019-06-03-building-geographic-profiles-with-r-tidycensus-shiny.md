As part of a project to expand AAPI Data to include data on other racial/ethnic groups, we have created [RacialData](http://racialdata.com) which features data on all racial and ethnic groups in the United States. In addition, we have launched a new tool called [Geoprofiles](http://apps.racialdata.com/geoprofiles)
