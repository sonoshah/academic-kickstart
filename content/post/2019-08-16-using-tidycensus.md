I put together a short presentation on how to work with data from the U.S. Census using the excellent `tidycensus` package. 

- The slides live [here](https://sonoshah.github.io/tidycensuspresentation/slides#1)
- You can download the starter code [here](https://sonoshah.github.io/tidycensuspresentation/examples.r).
