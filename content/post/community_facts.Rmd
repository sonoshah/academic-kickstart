As part of my work at AAPI Data, I also create tools to increase the accessibility of demographic data, my most recent project was to create a Community Factsheet tool using shiny, check it out [here](http://facts.aapidata.com/). ![community-facts](/img/aapidata_facts.gif)

Community facts is a simple Shiny App that displays demographic data from the ACS.
