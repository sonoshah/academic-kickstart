<p>As part of my work at AAPI Data, I also create tools to increase the accessibility of demographic data, my most recent project was to create a Community Factsheet tool using shiny, check it out <a href="http://facts.aapidata.com/nationaldata/">here</a>. <img src="/img/aapidata_facts.gif" alt="community-facts" /></p>
<p>Community facts is a simple Shiny App that displays demographic data from the ACS.</p>
