## Lab 1: Exploring county-level election data

## Lab 2: Developing Voter Targets

In today’s lab you will be acting as a campaign strategiest, developing vote targets for counties in California. In each part, you will be given a set of data that you will use to estimate the number of votes Clinton and Trump recieved in the 2016 Presidential Election. In each part, you will encounter a different set of counties with different types of available data. You will have to decide how you will develop vote targets given the set of data in each part, use what you know about voter participation, and the readings in lecture to help inform your logic.^[what is this shit]

## Lab 3: Social Media Data

In this lab, we will be working with data pulled directly from twitter. The most recent estimates show that Twitter alone has about 328 million active monthly users. Lucky for us, people tweet about everything! Although restaurant reviews and folks’ opinons about Game of Thrones probably doesn’t matter much for political scientists like us. . . We can use their opinions about candidates, and their policy preferences! In other words, it’s a really cheap, and quick way to collect contextual information about elections and public opinion.

## Lab 4: CCES Data

Today, we will be working with real public opinion data from the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). The CCES is a 50,000+ national stratified sample survey that is fielded during two waves during election years and is extremely popular for political science research. This data is what you will be using in your final paper project. (Lab Developed w/ [Stephanie DeMora](http://www.stephaniedemora.com/))
