Welcome to my course page for Presidential Elections. One of my major goals for this class, was for my students to get some exposure to working with real data. I designed this course to allow for a large amount of hands-on activities. Students work with multiple datasets using Hadley Wickamâ€™s excellent [Tidyverse package](https://www.tidyverse.org/) in R. Some of the planned labs include: working with county-level election returns, scraping twitter for sentiment analysis, and exploring the 2016 CCES.

I used this class as an opportunity to experiment with different Rmarkdown formats, so you'll see a variety of file types, themes, and styling.

Check out the links to the left to look at the different tutorials, labs, and assignments.

## How to use some of the packages in the Tidyverse:
